# Protobuf
Client-Server program using Protocol Buffers.

This is a very basic vanilla program to depict the usage of protocol buffers to serialiase/deserialise structured data. The client/server model helps to show how the data is transferred between two applications.

I am using golang for the first time to implement this. I have a similar requirement in my current project in work and starting off with a small application seems to be the right starting point to help me wrap my head around protocol buffers and golang.
